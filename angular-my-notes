Q) what is a module in angularjs?
a) A module is a container for different parts of your application say directives, controllers, services, filters, expressions etc.

---> A Module can be treated as a entry point of tour application

----> Can create a module using 
      var myapp = angular.module("name",[dependencies])

Q) what is a controller?
A) In angular, controller is a javascript function. The responsibility of a controller is to create a model for the view(html) to display

eg: var mycontroller = function($scope){
}

note: need to register controller with module say like below

myapp.controller("mycontroller",function($scope){
  $scope.message = "hello angular world";
});

Q) Why we need as controller?
A) The job of the controller is to built a model for the view (how?: It does by attaching a model to the scope)


Angular Error scenario:
## What happens when controller name is mispelled

	-: An Error is raised .Use developer tools to see what the error is about?
	-:The data binding expressions in the view under the controller will not be evaluated

## What happens when property name is mispelled in data binding expressions of a controller?
	-:Angular will not report error that means it simply returns a null value.
	
## Why do we get 404 error if we use data binding expressin in the src attribute of image tag?
	-:Here First html DOM is parsed and then it looks for the specified source in src tag which is not available.
	-:secondarily, when angular evaluates databinding expression, then src url is evaulated from controller.
	-:As a result two requests to server to fetch url

	  so the solution is use ng-src attribute(so that ng-src is loaded when angular starts evaluating angular expression)

## What happens when we use a data model which is not defined?

	-:Internally angular created that data model and defined to null

Note: 
	* ng-model can be used with any <input/> element type, textArea and <select/> 
	
Q) What filters can do?
A) Filters can format, sort and filter data.

	 syntax:
	{{expression | filterName: parameter}}

eg:    {{expression | lowercase}} , {{expression | uppercase}}, {{expression | date: dd//mm//yy}}, 
	{{exp | currency:"$":2}},  {{exp | limitTO:2}} 


Note: *Filters can be used with binding expressions or a directive(like limitTo for ng-repeat)

Q)orderby filter?
A)used to sort data in ascending or descending order. 

syntax:{{exp |orderBy: exp: reverse(optional)}}
eg: {{employee in employees |orderBy: 'salary': false}}(By default false ascending order)

can also use + and - sign to sort in ascending or desc order

eg: {{employee in employees |orderBy: '+salary'}}
